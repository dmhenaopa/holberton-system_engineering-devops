## :pencil2: Networking basics 2
This folder contains some useful scripts with basic commands  to change home IP and displays IPv4 IPs.
### Requirements:
All commands were tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Although the commands might work fine on other distributions, versions or operative systems.

### Usage:
Verify that the files have execution permissions before being used! **If not, use the following command:**

    chmod u+x name_of_file ###To make the file executable

In all cases, all files, the way to execute them is by putting a period and a slash before the command name. As follows:

    ./name_of_file ###To execute the file

### Executable files:

## :pencil2: Loops, conditions and parsing

This folder contains some useful scripts with basic Shell commands and topics like the use of while, until and for loops. Also, how to use  if, else, elif and case condition statements. How to use cut command and the comparison operators. 

### Requirements:
All commands were tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Although the commands might work fine on other distributions, versions or operative systems.

### Usage:
Verify that the files have execution permissions before being used! **If not, use the following command:**

    chmod u+x name_of_file ###To make the file executable

In all cases, all files, the way to execute them is by putting a period and a slash before the command name. As follows:

    ./name_of_file ###To execute the file

### Executable files:
